# E2E queue

> **POLICY CHANGE (2026-10-04, user instruction):** e2e tests are **DEFERRED again**.
> Do NOT run `tools/harness/test-e2e.ps1` (incl. `-Tests <subset>`) until the user says so.
> Every item from now on uses the **unit-only lane** and appends its e2e gate here with
> **Status: QUEUED**. Run the queued gates later on a VS-capable machine when the user
> authorizes it. (The no-VS harness-health self-checks — `-List`, `-SelfCheck`,
> `check-doc-refs.ps1` — remain allowed.)

**Status: EMPTY (2026-10-02).** Every previously-queued e2e gate has been run GREEN and
removed from the active queue.

## What was removed and why

The deferred gates from the earlier unit-only-lane plans were all satisfied by the
**72-findings plan's full 35-scenario e2e suite run (2026-10-02, GREEN)** — every
scenario those gates reference was exercised and passed on the VS-capable machine:

- **Architecture consolidation (2026-09-28):** `E2E-AC-1..5`.
- **Code review findings, 75 findings (2026-09-29):** `E2E-CR-1..3`,
  `E2E-M3/M40/M24/M16/M34/M17/M32/M1/M4/M5-M8/M28/M36/M37/m26/m28/M20/M29/M42`.
- **Code review findings, 98 findings + Functional restructure (2026-10-01):**
  `E2E-NCR-1..2`, `E2E-NCR-M2/M4/M5/M3/M7/m47`, `E2E-RESTRUCTURE-2`,
  `E2E-NCR-BACKLOG`.
- **Code review findings, 67 findings (2026-09-30):** `E2E-NCR-67-*`,
  `E2E-RESTRUCTURE-67-1`.
- **Code review fixes, 51 findings (2026-10-02):** `E2E-CR51-1..10`.
- **Code review fixes, 72 findings (2026-10-02):** `E2E-CR72-1..10` — RUN at VERIFY
  (the full 35-scenario suite was the item's final gate).

## Adding a new gate

When a plan defers e2e work (unit-only lane), append its gates here with:
- an ID, the finding/step it covers, the scenario list, and the assertion;
- **Status:** QUEUED.

Run: `pwsh tools/harness/test-e2e.ps1 -Tests <scenario-list>` (or the full suite for the
final entry). Remove a gate once it has run GREEN.
